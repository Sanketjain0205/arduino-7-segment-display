# Arduino 1-Digit 7-Segment Display

This project shows how to use a 1-digit 7-segment display with Arduino Uno.
It is designed for beginners and school students.

## Display Type
Common Cathode / Anode
Common pin connected to GND / 5V

## Pin Connections
a → 2  
b → 3  
c → 4  
d → 5  
e → 6  
f → 7  
g → 8  

## Components Required
- Arduino Uno
- 1-digit 7-segment display
- 220Ω resistors (2)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires (Male to Male)

## Output
The display counts from 0 to 9 with a 1-second delay.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding digital outputs
- Using arrays and loops
